Insert SMILE =D Here!

I am Christina. I believe in life, love, and laughter. [That's how it's done son!]
However, I am a closet geek/nerd and I enjoy every nuance and learning opportunity thrown my way.
I love toes in the sand, ocean in my nose, and sun on my back...and also tacos.
Never had moon tacos...but they sound Yum!
